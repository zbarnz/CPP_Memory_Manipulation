# Memory Manipulation

## Startup:
Launch the dummy program in a terminal. The initial output should look something like this:
```
❯ .\dummy.exe
Process ID: 6200

varInt (0xcde49ffac8) = 123456
varString (0xcde49ffaa0) = DefaultString

varArr (0xcde49ffa20) = Long char array right there ->
varPtr2Int (0xcde49ffa18) = 0xcde49ffac8
varPtr2Int2 (0xcde49ffa10) = 0xcde49ffa18
varPtr2Int3 (0xcde49ffa08) = 0xcde49ffa10

Press ENTER to print again
```
The output container variables of different data types and their corresponding memory adresses. There are also a few chained pointers.

Next, launch either the reader or writer application in a terminal and follow the prompts. You will either be able to read what is in any memory adress or write to a memory adress and view the updated output in the first terminal by hitting ENTER.
```
❯ .\dummy.exe
Process ID: 6200

varInt (0xcde49ffac8) = 987654
varString (0xcde49ffaa0) = DefaultString

varArr (0xcde49ffa20) = Long char array right there ->
varPtr2Int (0xcde49ffa18) = 0xcde49ffac8
varPtr2Int2 (0xcde49ffa10) = 0xcde49ffa18
varPtr2Int3 (0xcde49ffa08) = 0xcde49ffa10

Press ENTER to print again
```
